```lrc
[00:23.16] I feel alone, even at home
[00:34.24] Rather be outside, a cat in the cold
[00:44.40] Make lots of new friends, we don't have to speak
[00:55.26] Explore in the night time, don't need to be seen
[01:19.26] 
[01:05.68] I'm trapped in my bedroom, inside my bad dreams
[01:11.42] I pray for a good one, but we'll just have to see
[01:16.89] Closing my eyes, holding my rabbit's hand
[01:22.45] If you somehow need me, you know where I'll be
[01:45.45] 
[01:54.01] Got up at 2pm, just to fall back asleep
[02:00.03] Another day is gone, I don't want to be me
[02:05.31] I don't think I could be more than I am
[02:10.87] But people in my life, they believe in me
